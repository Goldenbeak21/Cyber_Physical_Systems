# Multi-Variate Time Series Analysis using LSTM/GRU

- Developed a dual attention based LSTM and GRU models to pre-emtively detect anomalies in a power plant. 
- Used spatial input and temporal attention to extract important features and thereby reduced the false alarm rate and improved the detection accuracy.
